This instrument contains 14 questions or types of symptoms associated with anxiety such as fear, mood, insomnia, and somatic symptoms, which is completed during a semi-structured interview. Each symptom is rated on a scale of 0-4 with 0 being none and 4 being the most severe. A score of 0-17 is considered 'mild', while a score of 18-24 is 'mild to moderate' and a score greater than 24 is 'moderate to severe.'",,,,,,,,
