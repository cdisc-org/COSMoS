Each symptom is rated on a scale of 0-4 with 0 being none and 4 being the most severe. A score of 0-17 is considered 'mild', while a score of 18-24 is 'mild to moderate' and a score greater than 24 is 'moderate to severe.'",1,Clinical or Research Assessment Classification (C118969); Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale Clinical Classification (C102118),0
