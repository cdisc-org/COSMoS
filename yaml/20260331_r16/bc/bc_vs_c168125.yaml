definition: An assessment performed to estimate peripheral perfusion and hydration status. The test is most often conducted by applying constant manual pressure for a set time on a patient's nail bed and then releasing while observing the length of time it takes for color to return to the tissue. A prolonged return to baseline coloring may indicate compromise of peripheral blood flow.
