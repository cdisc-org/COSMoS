definition: "The mean pressure of the blood within the arterial circulation. The arterial pressure may be directly measured by insertion of an intra-arterial catheter connected to a transducer. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be calculated by subsequent analysis of the waveform. MAP can be approximated without an invasive procedure using the following formula: diastolic pressure plus 1/3 of the pulse pressure, where pulse pressure is systolic pressure - diastolic pressure."
