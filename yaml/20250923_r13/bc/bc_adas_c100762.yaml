shortName: "Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive CDISC Version Functional Test"
definition: "The CDISC version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (CDISC ADAS-Cog) containing 15 summary-level tests. This version is based on combining the total pool of ADAS-Cog tests that were observed during a review of multiple case report forms administered in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the CRF administered in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) observational study.
