definition: "The major metabolite of the potentially carcinogenic nitrosamine 4-methylnitrosamino-1,3-pyridyl-1-butanone (nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone; NNK) that is detected in the urine of subjects exposed to tobacco products. 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (nicotine-derived nitrosamine alcohol; NNAL) is produced by carbonyl reduction of NNK and may also be a carcinogen."
